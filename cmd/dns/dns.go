It queries multiple DNS record types including:
  - A and AAAA (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses)
  - CNAME (Canonical name)
  - MX (Mail exchanger)
  - TXT (Text records)
  - NS (Name servers)

The results are printed in a structured format per host. Use the --file flag to specify the input file.

Example:
  net-scan dns --file hosts.txt

Each line in the input file should contain a single hostname.`,
