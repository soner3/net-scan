You can provide hosts to delete directly as command-line arguments:
  net-scan host delete host1 host2 host3

Alternatively, you can provide a list of hosts via stdin:
  cat remove-these.txt | net-scan host delete

Each host must be on a separate line when passed via stdin.

The updated host list will be saved to the configured hosts file (default: net-scan.hosts).`,
