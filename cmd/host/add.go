You can provide hosts directly as command-line arguments:
  net-scan host add host1 host2 host3

Alternatively, you can provide a list of hosts via stdin:
  cat hosts.txt | net-scan host add

Each host must be on a separate line when passed via stdin.

All added hosts will be saved to the configured hosts file (default: net-scan.hosts).`,

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// addCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// addCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
